oh, yeah, baby whats wrong with the world today you say?<br>
<br>
First to mind, <br>
<br>
 - Cultural Isolation<br>
<br>
  There is a barrier to the diffusion of cultures due to political, linguistic, and geographic concerns. <br>
<br>
  I believe software has already began to solve some of these issues. In example, translation software is getting better allowing cross language communication to be possible for the people. When I say the people I mean those not searching for it and this point is important. For some, translation has been sought and gained throughout history. Today this is easier due to software but it is still has an accessible tool, not a channel of broadcast. It must be as television is, where even if you are not choosing to consume the media, it is still prevalent, unavoidable, accessible to a fault. If this was the case with global media and exchange in a translanguage fashion the linguistic barrier to cultural diffusion would be weakened if not dispersed.<br>
<br>
  This directly leads into communication technologies, which in part, have negated a portion of the geographic concern. There is something to be said about the loss of touch, taste, and smell when it comes to interpersonal contact but at least there's two senses covered. Some time ago I was on the website omegle late at night and a manager in a factory in china began video chatting me. I pasted his words verbatim into google-translate and responded accordingly. It was difficult at first but communication became steadily easier. There was definite difference in our world views, which may or may not be due to cultural differences but I think the point is clear. I was able to have a conversation in a language I did not speak  with an individual on the other side of the planet for free with little effort. <br>
<br>
  The last to address is the politics of nations which prevents cultural diffusion. While the role of software within political affairs may be of little impact, I'd like to draw focus towards the life of Aaron Swartz. He was an individual who came from software and left an impact on the global political landscape. His works with creative commons can be said to achieve greater cultural transmission internationally, and I would not be the first to articulate his tragic death as political martyrdom. I think Julian Assange is another individual disseminating strong nationalism in attempts to breed a more global perspective amongst humanity.<br>
<br>
  But why is cultural diffusion something that should be sought after. I've heard the nationalistic credo that multiculturalism dilutes the native geographic culture, and that we should prize the diversity of pure many-culturism over multiculturalism, or even more fearful uniculturalism, but I think this is old world rhetoric used to veil racism and power grabs. When I think of cultural diffusion it is not the dilution of a nation's culture into a greater world view, for this is not really how I see culture functioning in the 21st century.<br>
<br>
  Culture in the 21st century is built around niche communities and small factions. By removing the borders these communities will fertilize and pollinate, causing a widespread revitalization and proliferation of new ideas which will be pervasive across all of humanities interests. I'd like to draw into to focus the spread and diversification of christianity over the past two millennia. A simple but powerful idea has now 40,000 incarnations, all interacting with each other subtly over a common ground, all deeply intimate and intricate. Another example would be the relation of rock music between britain and america in the 20th century. We saw a dialogue that occurred under a common banner but with different manifestations, each beautiful and just in its own. You see, I deeply believe that we are just beginning. I see a world of crude ideas articulated well. The limitless potential in humanity has barely been scratched. If the summation of our knowledge to this point has lead to one thing, it is there are vastly more interesting questions worth asking than we could of ever imagined. That there are so many tasks worth accomplishing. That this rusty leaky bucket of a civilization is not a home, but our home. We have only recently stumbled upon the vocabulary to began asking stronger, farther reaching questions, which with work will be answered. Youtube artist vsauce estimates the number of possible thoughts to be 1.458x10^227, I wonder what else this staggering number may contain. By removing the barriers to the transmission and diffusion of culture a wealth of new ideas will naturally arise. <br>
<br>
   In concession, at this point one would have to accept a dialectic of human progress. It could be said that we are in truth entering a new dark age. That all progress has been an illusion. With each year new car models flood the roadways. Are these new cars truly progress, or rather the stagnant articulation of cars. While the fuel efficiency may increase, albeit with diminishing returns, we are not redefining transportation, or cheeseburgers, or iphones, or any other product. This goes beyond products though, we live in a society infatuated with decadence. There is limited potential for the lower class to succeed. At large there is a growing obsession with the commoditization of anything and everything. And this cycle could flounder indefinitely, or at least into the next generation.<br>
<br>
   I argue that the transmission of culture and subsequent proliferation of new ideas will give a large populous the necessary tools to build the world of their desires. No longer will the predominant vocabulary be one of product and commodity, of the perverse necessity for desire or assaults of disengaged irony. There will be a new global dialogue creating bonds across all borders, strengthening and uplifting humanity at large.<br>
